                    <h2>When I got Holly...</h2>
                    <p>Holly was given to my family when she was eight months old. She was given to us by my Great Uncle Frank. After a series of unfortunate events took place, my uncle was no longer able to care for Holly. He was on the hunt for a new home for her.</p>
                    <p>Uncle Frank asked if we would take and reluctantly, my mom agreed to take her in.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>I was twelve when we took in Holly. I had been begging for a puppy for as long as I could remember. so, for me, this was about the happiest day of my life. However, it was not an easy transition for all of us. My uncle had spoiled Holly and let her do things that mom would absolutely not allow. It was going to be a bumpy road for a hot minute.&nbsp;</p>

        <h1>Retraining Holly</h1>
        <div class="container">
            <div class="col-lg-8 mx-auto">
                <p>The first thing we had to change was Holly's potty habits. She had been trained to go potty on a mat in the house. That was a big no for us, so thus began the potty training. Then we had to train her to stay off of our furniture because my mom firmly believes that furniture is for people. We had to suffer many puppy-crying-filled nights as Holly adjusted to sleeping downstairs by herself and not up in a bed with someone. Last but not least we had to train her to stay in our yard. This was just so it was more convenient for us.&nbsp;</p>

                    <h2>Holly Now&nbsp;</h2>
                    <p>Holly is a very good girl now. She never jumps on the furniture and she stays in our yard, at least until her favorite neighbor is outside. She does not cry and whine at night (though that may or may not be because I let her sleep in my room).&nbsp; Holly has become my best friend, as dogs tend to do, Though the circumstances that led to her being my dog were less than ideal, I am forever grateful that we were the family that got to take her in. She has a crazy personality and she is always making me and my family laugh. Holly is full of attitude, but she is sweet and loyal. I would not trade her for any other dog in the world.&nbsp;</p>
