        <h2>Freshman in Greenville, South Carolina</h2>
        
         <p>I am a freshman at Bob Jones University studying liberal arts. I work hard for good grades, but also to understand what I am being taught.</p>
         <p>
            I attend Grace Baptist Fellowship Church in Greenville, SC. I enjoy playing my French horn and singing. 
            I attend church with my sister and my great aunt and unlce. 
            At church, I hope to develop freindships with good, godly people who draw me closer to God. 
         </p> 
         <p>
            I love listening to music and value deep conversations. Music calms me and makes me happy. Deep converstaions open me up to new ideas.
